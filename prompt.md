I want to create a mobile friendly website for people to RSVP for my wedding.

I want to connect the RSVP to a Google Form.

I want to also show the venue detail for the wedding ceremony.

I want to also show the suggested areas to stay with a hotel recommendation.

Lastly, I want to create a page where people can see what there is to do in the city based on what is bookmarked on my Google Maps list.

I want the design to look modern and minimalistic.
